- #podcast: **AppStories** episode **200 – Workflows Revisited: Calendars, Communications, and a Surprise** [11.1.2021]

Our main Sunday service is at 4.30pm. We are online on Facebook live. Every Sunday morning I put a post in our Facebook group asking people what they are thankful to God for and invite them to include photos if they want to. 
I then read out all the comments in the service as our praise and show any photos on screen. I started this to help them feel engaged in the service and also to remind them that praising God is not just about singing together (which we are all missing desperately) but that even in a pandemic, there are things to be thankful to God for. For the last 10 months I’ve had comments ranging from a roaring coal fire, a good piece of cake, fundraising success and feuding families being reunited and much much more. 
This morning, after reading 11 comments already I am a bit overwhelmed by how they now so easily share these blessings, and attribute them to God. 
I just wanted to share this to encourage you all. God is at work in our parishes, in our congregations.
