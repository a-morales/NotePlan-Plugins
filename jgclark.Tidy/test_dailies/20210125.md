- @jgctweets tweet: "Very disappointed in this Q from @cofestats* about last year's returns. You seriously don't want to know about the amazing and creative things parishes did online? Literally underlining the fact, too. Fair enough to ask a follow-up about online, but ... you didn't. *approx https://t.co/cpnWeYy0df" ([permalink](http://twitter.com/jgctweets/status/1353693433412677633))

- @jgctweets tweet: "Ridiculous ‘support’ call with @virginmedia. Problem is with your Hub’s WiFi, a symptom of which is your media box has no network connection.  Suggesting we need to “turn the TV and unplug it at the wall” is going to help exactly how?" ([permalink](http://twitter.com/jgctweets/status/1353706096175812610))

- @jgctweets tweet: "@virginmedia Thanks, but you’re not helping. Why would “service issues in the area” affect the WiFi from your router/hub when wired connections are fine? Worrying too that you think your colleague might not have checked that at the start of being on the phone for an hour?" ([permalink](http://twitter.com/jgctweets/status/1353794106678530048))
