A PRAYER FROM BISHOP MICHAEL CURRY
(He is the Presiding Bishop of my brother’s Church in the USA.
He was invited to contribute a prayer by Archbishop Justin)
Gracious God, may we who follow Jesus be strengthened
through the power of the Spirit to both practice and share his
way of love through our evangelistic witness and our
commitment to justice, peace and reconciliation.

May God continue to empower all of us in this Anglican branch
of the Jesus movement to take seriously our missional call to
turn, learn, pray, worship, bless, go, and rest.
And may that blessed grace that has led us all this far continue
to lead us still, for the love of God and the sake of all God’s
children.
This we pray through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.
